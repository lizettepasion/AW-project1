        <h1 id="home">Welcome to my journal!</h1>
        <p>Hi there! I’m <strong>Liz</strong> — a (soon to be) grade 12 student who loves creating, learning, and exploring new ideas. No matter if I’m working on a design project, drawing something, or just doing school work, I enjoy finding ways to make things both useful and beautiful.When I’m not at my desk, you’ll probably find me bedrooting, exploring new places, or just listening to music. This site is a little corner of the internet where I share what I’m up to, what I’m into, and whatever else feels right. Glad you’re here!</p>
        <p>Feel free to check me on my social media!</p>

        <h4>Here are some facts about my life!</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I was born in February 2008 in Cuernavaca Mexico. Cuernavaca is a city 2 hours away from Mexico's capital, Mexico city. The city is pretty much known because of its eternal spring weather and (sadly) the insecurity of the city overall.</li>

            <li>I lived with my parents and my brother until I was 9 years old. My parents got divorced and I went to live with my mom and brother to another town. (It's okay guys I'm not traumatized).</li>

            <li>My brother moved to cancun because of work after a few years living together. My mom and I went to visit him once. It was pretty nice!</li>

            <li>My dad moved to Canada in 2021. In 2023 after I graduated from middle school (in Mexico we graduate in grade 9) I moved to Canada.</li>
            <img src="images/IMG-20230728-WA0038.jpg" width="250" alt="Photo of me in my first day in Canada">
            <li>I was really shy when I came here. I was insecure about my english and I was afraid of not making friends at all. It took me some time to adapt but now I feel much better and have some friends! I'm enjoying my life in Canada and I'm getting my PR soon!</li>
            <img src="images/IMG_3045.JPG" width="250" alt="Photo of me and my friends at my 17th birthday party">
            <li>Back in grade 10, I was interested in becoming a doctor, but after doing my co-op placement at a hospital here in Toronto, I realized that I didn’t enjoy it. After a period of uncertainty about my future, I started getting into coding. Although I'm still a beginner, I've been enjoying it so far.</li>

        <h2 id="my-accomplishments">My Accomplishments</h2>
        <h4>This part of the blog is dedicated to the many things I've done so far. (At least in canada)</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Toronto Stake Youth Council Co-chair - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</strong></li>
          <p>In 2024, I was called at church for this role. I basically plan activities with my team for the rest of the youth community we have at church. Sometimes we do recreational activities, faith-bulding activities and charity projects. Once in a while we plan a "Regional" activity where (most) Southern Ontario youth members participate, we usually have around 150 people in activities like that.</p>
          <li><strong>Class President of Young Women Organization - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints </strong></li>
          <p>For this role, I was called back in 2023. In this calling I usually help out the adult leaders with activities, give classes in sunday school, stuff like that. </p>
          <li><strong>Young Camp Leader - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</strong></li>
          <p>I did this last summer. Me and another 3 of my friends were in charge of taking care of the young campers and letting them know the schedule. I also ran a activity by myself.</p>
          <li><strong>Camp Journal Designer - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</strong></li>
          <p>I won't be able to go to camp this year but I still wanted to be involved so I was asked to design the journal for this year camp. The theme is green and capibaras :)</p>
          <li><strong>Art Mentorship Program - Toronto History Museums</strong></li>
          <p>In 2024, I was admitted to this program. I had the opportunity to learn textile techniques, such as dyeing fabric with natural materials and embroidering with the guidance of a professional. I also created my own art piece, which was exhibited for about two months at the Spadina Museum!</p>

          <li><strong>Volunteer - Toronto History Museum</strong></li>
          <p>In 2023, I started volunteering. I haven't been as active as before because of school and work. I usually assisted with events when needed but I also got to work for an exhibition.</p>
          <img src="images/IMG_1500.jpg" width="150" alt="Photo of my piece of art at the exhibition">
          <li><strong>SHSM Health and Wellness Student</strong></li>
          <p>In 2024, I got accepted to the SHSM program from my school. With this program I had the opportunity to be certificated with CPR, first-aid and infection control skills.</p>
          <li><strong>Honour Roll Student</strong></li>
          <p>In grade 10, I was awarded with the honour roll award because I achieved more than an 80% average. Hopefully I'll get one for grade 11 as well. :)</p>
          <li><strong>Intern at Baycrest as Recreation Assistant</strong></li>
          <p>From October 2023 to January 2024, I was accepted as an intern at Baycrest, a long-term care home. I assisted the recreation team with activities for the residents, such as bingo, arts and crafts, music theraphy. It was a rewarding experience that allowed me to connect with the residents and learn more about their lives. At the same time, this is where I realized that I didn't fit in the medical field.</p>
          <li><strong>SBEA Mentorship Program</strong></li>
          <p>I got accepted into this program this summer! I will be mentored by professionals and students in the field of business and entrepreneurship. This program is also affiliated with the Schulich School of Business at York University. I'm really excited to be part of this program!</p>
          <li><strong>Tech World Club Founder and President</strong></li>
          <p>I'm founding a club at my school called Tech World. The goal of this club is to create a safe space for students to learn about technology and coding. This club is a club from Hack Club! and we are also having guests speakers from the Univeristy of Toronto.</p>
